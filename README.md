## Project Scope
Our team is developing a 2D Multiplayer Trivia Game wherein players respond to questions in real-time to gain points. The objective at the end of the sprint is to have a working game with a working multiplayer room and minimal game logic.

#### Key Features/Deliverables:

Real-time question-based gameplay
Scoreboard and winner announcement
Start screen and instructions
Multiplayer lobby (using socket or shared session logic)
Styling and asset integration for improved UX

#### Out of Scope (for now):

User login/authentication
Customizable avatars
Advanced leaderboard or analytics

## Milestones and Timeline
Our key milestones correspond to the learning units:

Define project scope
Create GitHub repo and setup branch workflow
Plan component and logic structure with GitHub Copilot
Implement question logic and scoring
Basic multiplayer room setup
Have a playable version ready for demo
Add animations, audio, and responsive UI
Debug and refactor game logic
Polish UI/UX
Write README, walkthrough notes
Prepare for demo day


## Team Roles and Responsibilities

As we're a 3-person team, we've split the work according to our strengths, with flexible coordination across the sprint.

###  Nidhish Agarwal
**Role:** Lead Developer
**Responsibilities:**
Develop core gameplay logic
Implement GitHub Copilot suggestions in the codebase
Deal with debugging and resolve hard edge cases

###  Isaac Reji(Me)
**Role:** UI/UX Designer + Frontend Developer

## Coordination Plan
1. Daily updates through **G-Chat**
2. Utilize **GitHub Projects** board for tracking tasks
3. **Google Meet** twice a week for syncing and debugging
4. Roles are primarily static, but we assist each other when necessary

## Anticipated Challenges and Strategies
#### Challenges:
GitHub merge conflicts
Lack of familiarity with Copilot suggestions
Time limitations due to parallel tasks
Trouble debugging multiplayer logic

#### Stratergies:
Review PRs and merge using feature branches together
Dedicate one session on wandering through prompt patterns and evaluating outputs
Sprint plan with buffer time, adhere to daily to-do checklist
Have backup saves of functional code, debug in pairs

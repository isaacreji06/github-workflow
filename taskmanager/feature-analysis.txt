Feature Analysis Report
PROJECT: Task Manager App
FEEDBACK ANALYZED: None (feature chosen based on obvious user need)

 QUICK WIN IDENTIFIED
Feature: Use localStorage to store tasks

Impact: High

Effort: Low

Without saving tasks between sessions, the app loses usability. This feature ensures that users' tasks persist even after a page refresh, solving a major real-world issue.

USER STORY
“As someone using this task app, I want my tasks to be saved in the browser so I don’t lose them.”

KEY COPILOT PROMPT USED
// add tasks to the localstorage
// Load tasks from localStorage on page load

IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
I added saveTasks() to serialize tasks and store them in localStorage, and modified the addTask() and window.onload functions to save and reload tasks.
